MineSwifter
===========

MineSwifter is a basic MineSweeper game that I created by using the new Apple's Swift language, and SpriteKit for the graphic part.

It all started as a college project, a classic MineSweeper using recursivity, made in C and running only in command line.
Once it was finished, I thought it would be great to have a little UI, at least being able to click the tiles.

So, I also wanted to try out the SpriteKit+Swift combination, and this project seemed a nice way to start.

This game isn't meant to be either complex, difficult, or even anything to show-off, it's only the result of having a little fun porting a pure command-line project to a SpriteKit+Swift one.

It also shows the solution to a couple of issues I faced while developing it, such as detecting the current clicked node, or reacting to right-click events.
